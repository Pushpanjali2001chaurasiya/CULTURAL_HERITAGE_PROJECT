                            <p>Qutub Minar is a towering minaret that stands as a testament to the architectural brilliance of the Delhi Sultanate. Constructed in 1193 by Qutb-ud-din Aibak, the founder of the Delhi Sultanate, it was later completed by his successor, Iltutmish. The minaret is made of red sandstone and marble, and it stands at a height of 73 meters, making it one of the tallest minarets in the world. The Qutub Minar is adorned with intricate carvings and verses from the Quran, showcasing the artistry and craftsmanship of the period.</p>
                            <p>The Qutub Minar complex also houses several other historically significant structures, including the Quwwat-ul-Islam Mosque, which is the first mosque built in India, and the Iron Pillar, which dates back to the 4th century and is renowned for its rust-resistant composition. The complex is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and attracts millions of visitors each year, who come to marvel at its historical and architectural significance.</p>
                            <p>Qutab Minar, one of the tallest brick minarets in the world, is an incredible example of early Indoâ€“Islamic architecture. It was built in 1193, but the reason remains a mystery. Some believe that it was made to signify victory and the beginning of Muslim rule in India, while others say it was used to call the faithful to prayer. The tower has five distinct stories, and is covered with intricate carvings and verses from the holy Quran. There are also a number of other historic monuments on the site.</p>
