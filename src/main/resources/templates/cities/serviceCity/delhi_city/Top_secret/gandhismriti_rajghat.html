                            <p>Gandhi Smriti, formerly known as Birla House, is a museum dedicated to Mahatma Gandhi, located on Tees January Road in New Delhi. This historic site is where Gandhi spent the last 144 days of his life before being assassinated on January 30, 1948. The museum houses the Eternal Gandhi Multimedia Museum, which was established in 2005 and offers a comprehensive look at Gandhi’s life and legacy through various exhibits. Visitors can explore the room where Gandhi lived and see the spot where he was assassinated, marked by a Martyr’s Column. The museum also features photographs, sculptures, paintings, and other memorabilia related to Gandhi’s life and his role in India’s struggle for independence.</p>
                            <p>Raj Ghat is a memorial dedicated to Mahatma Gandhi, located on the banks of the Yamuna River in Delhi. It marks the spot where Gandhi was cremated on January 31, 1948.
