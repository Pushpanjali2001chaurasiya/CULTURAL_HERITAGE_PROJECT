                            <p>Delhi's most famous monument, the Red Fort, stands not only as a powerful reminder of the Mughal era India but also a symbol of India's struggle for freedom. It was build by fifth Mughal emperor Shah Jahan, when he decided to shift his capital there from Agra in 1638. The fort's turbulent history includes being captured by the Sikhs and the British. To take your imagination back to the ancient era, a one hour sound and light show of the fort's history is held each evening.</p>
                            <p>The Red Fort, also known as Lal Qila, is a historic fortification in the heart of Old Delhi, India. Commissioned by the Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan in 1638, the fort was completed in 1648 and served as the main residence of the Mughal emperors for nearly 200 years. The fortâ€™s name comes from its massive red sandstone walls, which enclose a complex of palaces, entertainment halls, projecting balconies, baths, indoor canals, and geometrical gardens, along with an ornate mosque.</p>
