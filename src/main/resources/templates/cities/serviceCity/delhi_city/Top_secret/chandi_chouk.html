                            <p>Chandni Chowk, also known as Moonlight Square, is one of the oldest and busiest markets in Old Delhi, India. Established in the 17th century by Princess Jahanara Begum, the beloved daughter of Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan, Chandni Chowk has evolved into a bustling hub of commerce, culture, and cuisine
                                Chandni Chowk was designed by Princess Jahanara Begum in 1650. The market was originally divided by canals to reflect moonlight, which is how it got its name. The canals have long since disappeared, but the market remains a vibrant and chaotic center of activity. The Red Fort, another architectural marvel from the Mughal era, is located at the eastern end of Chandni Chowk.</p>
                                <p>Today, Chandni Chowk is a bustling marketplace that offers a wide variety of goods, from traditional Indian wear to electronics, spices, and street food. The market is known for its narrow lanes, crowded shops, and the sheer variety of items available. It is also home to several historic landmarks, including the Sri Digambar Jain Lal Mandir and the Gauri Shankar Temple.</p>
                                <p>Location: Old Delhi, near the Red Fort and Jama Masjid.</p>
