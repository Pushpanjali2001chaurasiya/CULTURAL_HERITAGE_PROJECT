                            <p>The Jama Masjid, also known as Masjid-i-Jahan-Numa, is one of the largest and most renowned mosques in India. Located in Old Delhi, it was commissioned by the Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan and constructed between 1650 and 1656. The mosque stands as a magnificent example of Mughal architecture, showcasing the grandeur and artistic excellence of the era.</p>
                            <p>The Jama Masjid is an architectural marvel, built primarily with red sandstone and white marble. The mosque features three large domes made of white marble, which contrast beautifully with the red sandstone of the main structure. Two towering minarets, each 40 meters high, flank the mosque and provide a panoramic view of the bustling streets of Old Delhi. The mosqueâ€™s courtyard can accommodate up to 25,000 worshippers, making it a central place for communal prayers, especially on Fridays and during Islamic festivals.</p>
                            <p>Location: Opposite Chandni Chowk, Old Delhi. Near the Red Fort.</p>
