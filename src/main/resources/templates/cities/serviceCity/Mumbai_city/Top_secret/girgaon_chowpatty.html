            <p>I have Ganga Aarti at various places in India - Varanasi, Allahabad & Haridwar and I have to see that what we see here was the best one can see. It was a joy to see young Pandas takinging part in the Aarti, use of Electronic techlogy & sound system, special arrangement for visitors from abroad and in general, very disciplined, well organised event. My family were seated with foreign visitors and we had the best view of the Aarti. There was no Panda trying to hassel us, which I found a great change. There was a sponsore Havan before the Aarti and the music was as if we were watching a Bollywood film. My whole family enjoyed it, my sister insisted that my grand daughters floated a Diva in the river and also wash their fett and face with holy Ganga water from the river. It was one of the best expereince of Hindu rituals that I loved, normally greedy Pandas ruin everything.Girgaon Chowpatty, also known as Girgaum Chowpatty, is one of Mumbai’s most iconic beaches, located along the Queen’s Necklace adjoining Marine Drive in the Girgaon area. This public beach is a popular destination for both locals and tourists, offering a unique blend of cultural, recreational, and culinary experiences</p>
            <p>The name “Chowpatty” is derived from the Marathi words “chau-pati,” meaning four channels or creeks. Historically, the beach has been a significant part of Mumbai’s social and cultural fabric. It is particularly famous for the annual Ganesh Visarjan celebrations, where thousands of devotees gather to immerse idols of Lord Ganesha in the Arabian Sea, marking the end of the Ganesh Chaturthi festival.</p>
