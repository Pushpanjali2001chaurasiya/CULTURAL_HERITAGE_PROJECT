                            <p>Powai Lake is a picturesque artificial lake located in the northeastern suburb of Powai in Mumbai. This man-made reservoir was constructed in 1891 by the British to supply drinking water to the city of Bombay (now Mumbai)</p>
                            <p>The lake spans an area of about 2.1 square kilometers (520 acres) and has a depth that varies from 3 meters (9.8 feet) at the periphery to 12 meters (39 feet) at its deepest point. Initially, Powai Lake was intended to augment the water supply for Mumbai, but due to pollution and water quality issues, it was eventually deemed unfit for drinking.</p>
