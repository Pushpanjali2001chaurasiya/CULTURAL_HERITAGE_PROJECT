                            <p>The Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Vastu Sangrahalaya (CSMVS), formerly known as the Prince of Wales Museum of Western India, is a premier cultural institution in Mumbai. Established in 1922, the museum was founded to commemorate the visit of the Prince of Wales (later King George V) to India. The museum is located in the heart of South Mumbai, near the iconic Gateway of India, and is housed in a magnificent Indo-Saracenic style building designed by the British architect George Wittet.</p>
                            <p>The museum’s architecture is a blend of various styles, including Mughal, Maratha, and Jain, reflecting India’s rich cultural heritage. The building is surrounded by a lush garden of palm trees and formal flower beds, providing a serene environment for visitors. </p>
                            <p>The Art section features an impressive array of sculptures, paintings, and decorative arts from India and other parts of the world. Highlights include miniature paintings, textiles, and a significant collection of European paintings. The Archaeology section houses artifacts from the Indus Valley Civilization, as well as relics from the Maurya, Gupta, Chalukya, and Rashtrakuta periods.</p>
