            <p>The Basilica of Our Lady of the Mount, commonly known as Mount Mary Church, is a Roman Catholic basilica located in the Bandra neighborhood of Mumbai. This iconic church, perched atop a hillock near Lands End, offers stunning views of the Arabian Sea and the cityâ€™s skyline. </p>
            <p>The history of the basilica dates back to the 16th century when Jesuit priests brought a wooden statue of Our Lady from Portugal and placed it in a simple mud oratory on the hill. Over the centuries, the church has undergone several reconstructions and renovations. The current structure, built in 1904, is a beautiful edifice in stone that stands out for its grandeur and architectural elegance.</p>
