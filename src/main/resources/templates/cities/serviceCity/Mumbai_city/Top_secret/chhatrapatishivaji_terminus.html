                            <p>The Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus (CST), formerly known as Victoria Terminus, is a historic railway station and a UNESCO World Heritage Site located in Mumbai, India. This architectural marvel was designed by the British architect Frederick William Stevens and completed in 1888.</p>
                            <p>The construction of CST began in 1878 and took nearly a decade to complete. The station was originally named Victoria Terminus in honor of Queen Victoria, but it was renamed Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus in 1996 to honor the Maratha warrior king, Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj. In 2004, CST was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site, recognizing its architectural and historical significance</p>
                            <p>CST is not only an architectural marvel but also a bustling transportation hub. It serves as the headquarters of the Central Railway and is one of the busiest railway stations in India. The station handles both long-distance and suburban trains, connecting millions of passengers daily. </p>
