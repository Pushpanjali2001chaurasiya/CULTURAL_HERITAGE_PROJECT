                            <p>The Dwarkadhish Temple, touted as one of the holiest temples in Mathura, is famous all over the country for its elaborate architecture and paintings. Built in 1814, the temple is relatively new but is highly revered. The temple is dedicated to Lord Dwarkadheesh, a form of Lord Krishna known as Dwarkanath, depicted in a black marble idol.

                                An array of beautiful ceiling paintings showcasing the various aspects of the Lord's life and the beautiful Rajasthani architectural designs and carving makes the complex look even more magnanimous. The Dwarkadhish temple is currently managed by the followers of Vaishnava sect (started by Mahaprabhu Vallabhacharya) and is a centre for lots of interesting activities all year round especially during the Shravan months when the Lord's Idol is placed inside a Hindola a (type of a swing set). Other important festivals celebrated are Holi, Diwali and Janmashtami.
                                
                                Situated within the perimeter of the city's holy gate, near the ghats of River Yamuna, the temple and its surroundings are a hub of a lot of interesting activities. Thousands of devotees arrive here every day to pay their obeisance.</p>
