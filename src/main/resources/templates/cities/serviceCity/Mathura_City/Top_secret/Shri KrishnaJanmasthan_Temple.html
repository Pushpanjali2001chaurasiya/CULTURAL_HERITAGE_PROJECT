                            <p>The Chandi Devi Temple of Haridwar is a charming temple dedicated to the Chanda Devi Goddess, perched on the Neel Parvat of the Shivalik Hills. The Chandi Devi Mandir, also known as Neel Parvat Teerth, is one of the five pilgrimages of Haridwar and is also known as Siddha Peetha, a place where devotees worship to fulfil their desire. Because of its location, the Chandi Devi temple is also a preferred choice for trekking tourists. You can also reach the temple zenith by the means of a ropeway, the view from which is exhilarating.
                                The historic beauty of Chandi Devi Temple is best experienced as you hike your way up to the top. With the verdant greenery of the surrounding, you will certainly feel the presence of the divine around you. Being one of the oldest and revered temples in Haridwar, this shrine has a tremendous footfall throughout the year. One of the most festive time here is during the festivals of Chandi Chaudas, Navratra and Kumbh Mela when the temple sees amazing celebrations and massive participation. The Chandi temple during the festival time is a must visit.
