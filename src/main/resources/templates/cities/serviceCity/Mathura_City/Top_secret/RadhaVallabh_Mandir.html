                            <p>Situated near Gotam Nagar on the cliff near Bankey Bihari temple is the Radha Vallabh Mandir, one of the seven temples of Thakur of Vrindavan. This temple is the epitome of the sacred and divine love of Radha and Krishna, displayed in the rarest form 'Ras-bhakti'. Enshrined by Lord Krishna, the temple does not have a deity of Radha. Instead, it has a crown placed next to Lord Krishna to signify her presence.

                                Radha Vallabh Mandir stands out due to its striking architecture and magnificence decor. Constructed in 1585, the Radha Vallabh temple is one of the oldest and long-living temples, majestically built using red sandstones at a time when they were used for building only high palaces, imperial buildings and royal forts. The wall of the temple is 10 feet thick and are pierced in 2 stages.
                                
                                The Radha Vallabh Mandir is decked up for celebrations on the birth anniversary of Sri Harivansh Chandra Mahaprabhu as well as on Radha Ashtami. Pilgrims and devotees from all over the country visit the temple to witness the mystery and legends that this temple holds within.</p>
