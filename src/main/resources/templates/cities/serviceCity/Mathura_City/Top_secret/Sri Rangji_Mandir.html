                            <h2></h2>
                            <p>The Mansa Devi Temple is a famous temple in Haridwar in Uttarakhand that is dedicated to the goddess Mansa Devi, who is considered to be a form of Shakti and is believed to have emerged from Lord Shiva's mind. Thousands of Hindus flock to the temple every year in large numbers to this temple, which is one of the 'Panch Tirths' or the five pilgrimages in Haridwar. The temple is also popularly known as Bilwa Tirth and is perched on the top of the Bilwa Parvat on the Sivalik Hills.

                                The word Mansa means wish, and devotees firmly believe that the goddess Mansa fulfils all the wishes of a dedicated and sincere person who visits the temple. Thus, the magnificent temple is regarded as a 'Siddh Peetha', which is the term that is used to refer to places where desires and wishes get fulfilled. Together with the Maya Devi Temple and Chandi Devi Temple, the three temples constitute the three Peethas that are located in Haridwar.
                                
                                The Mansa Devi Temple holds immense religious importance, not only because of the temple itself but also because it is located in Haridwar, which is believed to be one of the four places where drops of elixir fell accidentally while they were being carried by Garuda, Lord Vishnu's vehicle. This is perhaps why this grand temple has one of the highest footfalls of all temples in north India. The ropeways that lead up to it are yet another feature that adds to the magnificence of the temple and attracts tourists from all across the country.</p>
