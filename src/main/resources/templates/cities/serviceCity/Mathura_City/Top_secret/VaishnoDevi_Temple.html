                            <p>A replica of the Vaishno Devi temple in Kashmir, the Vaishno Devi Temple of Haridwar is marked by tunnels and caves that lead to the inner sanctum containing the shrine of Goddess Vaishno Devi. The divine temple houses three deities - Lakshmi, Kaali and Saraswati. The Vaishno Devi Temple in Haridwar is a frequently visited site, both by religious devotees and nature lovers because of the stunning view of the surrounding landscape.

                                Apart from its architecture and tunnels, this temple bears no resemblance to the original Vaishno Devi Temple. After climbing a flight of steep stairs and crawling through a narrow tunnel, the devotees are blessed with the sight of the idol of Maa Vaishno Devi and the replicas of the 12 Jyotirlingas in India. It is widely believed that the Vaishno Devi Temple of Haridwar was constructed in the memory of Trikuta, a devotee of Lord Ram. She prayed to him so devotedly that he agreed to marry her in his last earthy carnation. This is also one of the Shakti Peethas temple.</p>
                                <p>The Vaishno Devi Temple is only 5km from the city railway station, being located in the Jagdish Nagar, Jwalapur area. Taxis are the most convenient mode of transport in the city and can be hired from any site.</p>
