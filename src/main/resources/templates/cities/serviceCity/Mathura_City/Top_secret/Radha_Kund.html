                            <p>Situated near Govardhan Hill in the small town in Mathura is one of the holiest places in Braja - the Radha Kund and Shyam Kund. The two holy water tanks lying next to each other are considered to be the supreme of all holy places, containing pure and sacred water, also known to contain magical properties to heal for conception.

                                The origin of Radha Kund Town dates back to the days of Radha and Krishna and stands as an epitome of their love and happily spent times. The tourists visiting Radha Kund are mostly pilgrims visiting to pay homage to their sacred love for Lord Krishna and his consort Radha and also to take a dip in the pond at the midnight, as per the customs. One can also spot many foreigners taking a dip in the Radha Kund.
