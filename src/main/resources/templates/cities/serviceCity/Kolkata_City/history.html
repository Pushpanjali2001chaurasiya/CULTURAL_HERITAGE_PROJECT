            <h2>History, Best Places to Visit and Travel Guide of Varanasi – One of Seven Sacred Cities of Hinduism, Uttar Pradesh, India</h2>
            <p>Kolkata, formerly known as Calcutta, is a city steeped in history and cultural significance. Its modern history began in the 17th century when the British East India Company acquired the villages of Kalikata, Sutanuti, and Gobindapur from the local rulers in 1698. The city's strategic location along the Hooghly River made it a pivotal trading post, and by 1772, it became the capital of British India. Kolkata flourished as a major center of commerce, politics, and culture under British rule.</p>

            <p>The 19th century was a period of transformation, as Kolkata became the heart of the Bengali Renaissance. This cultural movement, spearheaded by visionaries like Raja Ram Mohan Roy and Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar, aimed at modernizing and reforming Indian society, touching upon areas such as education, social justice, and literature. The city was also a focal point for political activism, contributing significantly to India’s struggle for independence. The Indian National Congress held its first session in Kolkata in 1885, and the city witnessed several political rallies and movements.</p>

            <p>Following India’s independence in 1947, Kolkata faced a series of challenges including the impact of the Partition, which resulted in a significant influx of refugees. Despite these difficulties, the city continued to thrive as a major cultural and intellectual hub, known for its vibrant arts scene, literary heritage, and educational institutions. The late 20th and early 21st centuries saw Kolkata adapting to economic changes while preserving its rich cultural legacy. The city remains a melting pot of traditions and modernity, reflecting its historical journey from a colonial trading post to a global city with a unique blend of old-world charm and contemporary dynamism.</p>
