                            <p>The Rumi Darwaza, also known as the Turkish Gate, is a magnificent gateway located in the heart of Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh. Constructed in 1784 by Nawab Asaf-ud-Daula, it stands as a remarkable example of Awadhi architecture. </p>
                            <p>The Rumi Darwaza is an imposing structure that features a large central arch topped with a half-spherical dome. The intricate floral carvings and the chhatri (umbrella) at the top add to its grandeur.</p>
                            <p>Historically, the Rumi Darwaza was constructed as part of a “Food for Work” program initiated by Nawab Asaf-ud-Daula during a severe famine. This initiative provided employment to the people of Lucknow, allowing them to earn food in exchange for their labor.</p>
                            <p>The Rumi Darwaza holds significant cultural and historical importance. It has become a symbol of Lucknow’s rich heritage and is often included in heritage tours of the city.</p>
