            <h2>Highlights key museums, galleries, and cultural centers in Chandigarh</h2>
            <p>Chandigarh was conceived as a symbol of post-independence modernity and progress. Its design by architect Le Corbusier was intended to embody principles of modernism, efficiency, and aesthetic purity. This vision included not only its physical layout but also an underlying ethos that influenced its cultural and social environment.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <p>As Chandigarh took shape, cultural institutions began to emerge. The Punjab University Museum and Art Gallery, established in the early 1960s, became a center for art and cultural exhibitions. The Government Museum and Art Gallery also played a role in promoting local and national heritage through its collection of artifacts, artworks, and historical exhibits.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <p>One of Chandigarh’s most unique cultural landmarks is the Rock Garden, created by Nek Chand. This sprawling sculpture garden, constructed from recycled materials and urban waste, represents a remarkable fusion of art and environmental consciousness. It reflects the city's capacity for creative expression and its commitment to incorporating diverse artistic elements into its landscape.</p>
            <p> Over the years, Chandigarh has developed a vibrant cultural scene with various festivals and events that celebrate its diverse heritage. The city hosts events such as the Chandigarh Carnival, Rose Festival, and the Chandigarh Literature Festival, which showcase local traditions, arts, and cultural diversity.</p>
            <p>Chandigarh’s architectural heritage is a crucial part of its cultural identity. Efforts to preserve and celebrate this heritage include maintaining Le Corbusier’s original design, organizing exhibitions on modernist architecture, and recognizing the city’s significance through initiatives like its tentative listing as a UNESCO World Heritage site.</p>
