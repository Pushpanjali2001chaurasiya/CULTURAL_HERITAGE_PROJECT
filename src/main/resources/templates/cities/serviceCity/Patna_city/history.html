            <h2>History, Best Places to Visit and Travel Guide of Patna – One of Seven Sacred Cities of Hinduism, Bihar, India</h2>
            <p>Patna, the capital city of Bihar, India, boasts a rich historical legacy that spans over 2,500 years. Originally known as Pataliputra, the city was a prominent center of power and culture in ancient India. Founded by Ajatashatru in the 5th century BCE, it rose to prominence as the capital of the Magadh Empire. Under the Mauryan Empire, particularly during the reign of Emperor Ashoka, Patna became a major hub of political and economic activity. The city flourished as a cultural and intellectual center, attracting scholars and monks, including the famous Chinese traveler Xuanzang.</p>
